# Structure and code conventions
The source code is located in the *src* folder.

For each chapter, there is a subfolder here with the name chapter_*number* (e.g. chapter_02, chapter_03, etc.)
For each different topic in a chapter, there is a different project. For instance:

* chapter_07\chapter_07_01 - Delegates and Events
* chapter_07\chapter_07_02 - Tuples
* chapter_07\chapter_07_03 - Pattern matching
* chapter_07\chapter_07_04 - Regular expressions

The solution file *learning_charp8.sln* contains all these projects together.

Most projects should be .NET Core console apps and target .NET Core 2.1. Excepted from this rule are the last chapters that introduce Windows programming with WPF and WinForms, mobile apps development with Xamarin, etc.
